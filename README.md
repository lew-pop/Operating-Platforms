# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room has a game application called Draw It or Lose It for Android systems. The Gaming room is interested in expanding their game cross-platform utilizing different software patterns. The gaming room is interested in evaluating three operating systems to deploy their game application software. The software will act as a server to deploy a web-based version of their game, Draw-it or Lose-it. The software must have one instance of the game in memory at once, one or more teams, multiple players per team, and game and team names must be unique. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The recommendations section of the software design document for The Gaming Room is the most vital aspect of this document. The Windows OS is my recommendation to deploy The Gaming Room server for their game, Draw-It or Lose-It. In the recommendations section, I analyzed the characteristics of the operating system, architecture, memory management, storage management, distributed systems, networks, and security. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the software design document allowed me to analyze different architectural design patterns to implement in developing the code for the software. Exploring the various operating systems and creating a chart helped visualize the various solutions and select the most effective operating system to deploy the software. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would update the evaluation section of the software design document to identify the latest updates and trends in the industry. Although the Windows OS is a dominant operating system, there are potential solutions that are more beneficial for The Gaming Room, such as cloud operating systems. Infrastructure as a service is a great idea to keep up with the trends and advancements in the industry.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is essential to interpret the client’s needs when developing the software design because they may have a client base that relies on their original gaming application, functionality, and data. Integrating a client’s application cross-platform can come with many risks. Client data, security, and integrity must be prioritized to transition to a web-based distributed environment. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I used clear, concise documentation addressing all of the client's software requirements to develop the Software Design Document. I would consider upcoming or latest trends to make recommendations for a software design to ensure it will be relevant and compatible long-term.
