# Operating Platforms and Requirement Analysis

## Repository Overview
This repository showcases my experience and skills in gathering business and software requirements, translating them into a detailed Project Software Design document, and implementing that design into a fully functional project directory. Inside this repository, you will find:
* Game App Project Design Document: This document provides an in-depth analysis and blueprint for the Draw It or Lose It game application.
* Game App Project Files: These files contain the complete codebase for the Draw It or Lose It game application, including source code, configuration files, and documentation.

## Client and Software Requirements
Client: The Gaming Room

Project: Draw It or Lose It - Cross-Platform Expansion

The Gaming Room, a video game and software developer, sought to expand their popular Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to a cross-platform environment. Their goal was to deploy a web-based version of the game, ensuring it supports multiple operating systems. Key requirements included:

* A single instance of the game in memory at a time.
* Support for multiple teams, each with multiple players.
* Unique names for games and teams to avoid conflicts.

## Key Contributions and Recommendations

In developing the software design document for The Gaming Room, I concentrated on the recommendations section, which I consider the most critical part of the document. I recommended implementing a Singleton software design pattern and deploying the game server on the Windows OS. This recommendation was based on a detailed analysis of various factors, including:

* Operating system architecture
* Memory management
* Storage management
* Distributed systems
* Network capabilities
* Security features

## Process and Learning

Working through the design document was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of different architectural design patterns and their implementation in software development. By evaluating various operating systems and creating comparative charts, I could effectively visualize and select the optimal solution for the deployment.

## Areas for Improvement

If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the evaluation section of the software design document. Updating it to reflect the latest industry trends and technological advancements would be beneficial. For instance, while Windows OS is robust, exploring cloud operating systems and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) could provide more flexible and scalable solutions for The Gaming Room.

## User-Centric Design

Interpreting and incorporating the user's needs into the software design was paramount. The client's existing user base relies on the current functionality and data of the gaming application. Therefore, ensuring data security and integrity during the transition to a web-based, distributed environment was a priority. A user-centric approach minimizes risks and enhances the overall user experience.

## Future Approaches
In future projects, I plan to:

* Maintain clear and concise documentation that comprehensively addresses client requirements.
* Stay updated with the latest trends to ensure recommendations are both relevant and forward-compatible.
* Use advanced analytical techniques to evaluate potential solutions, ensuring the chosen design is effective and sustainable.
